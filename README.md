# Discord-RPC-Maker
a simple rpc maker without watermarks because fuck ads  
(Using the [Discord-RPC Wrapper for Java](https://github.com/Vatuu/discord-rpc))
# Usage
Go to _[Discord's Developers site](https://discord.com/developers)_ and make a new _Application_,  
the name of the application would dictate the RPC title.  

After you make the new application open it, on the left sidebar click on Rich Presence, then Art Assets, scroll down and you should see a button that lets you upload images,  
upload 2 images, one for the big image and the second one for the small image. after that go back to General Information and copy the APPLICATION ID.  

And after all that you finally open config.txt and you can begin to customizing your RPC, just remember that for the "_bigimg_" you put the name of the big image you want, and the same goes for "_smallimg_" but for the small image you want. put the APPLICATION ID in "_appid_" and change the rest to whatever you want.  

Now you can just open up _main.bat_ and that's all,  
### Enjoy!
